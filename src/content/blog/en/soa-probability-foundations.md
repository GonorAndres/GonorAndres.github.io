The SOA-P syllabus looks familiar. The topics come to mind and you understand them abstractly -- axioms, conditional probability, Bayes, I've seen all of this in my degree. But when I started doing exercises the feeling changed completely. It feels more like set theory than probability theory. Most of this section uses sigma-algebra properties implicitly -- sure, someone can answer everything correctly without knowing what a "measure" is, but I was surprised by how much the perspective shifts when you see it from that angle.

And the difficulty isn't in understanding the concepts. It's in solving problems efficiently and cleanly. At first I tried to go as fast as possible, but my paper ended up disorganized and I couldn't find subtle mistakes I'd made three steps back. Then I tried the opposite approach: transcribing the full problem statement by hand, going slowly, step by step. But that way I was solving 30 questions in 5 hours -- more than the maximum the SOA allows for the entire exam. The balance between speed and clarity is part of the learning, not just the math.

This post is a study guide. I'm sharing the three foundational ideas in this section, why the SOA puts them first, and how they connect to real actuarial work.

## The language of uncertainty

Kolmogorov's axioms don't look, at first glance, like something that should matter to someone who wants to price insurance. Three abstract rules: the probability of any event is non-negative, the probability of the full sample space is one, and mutually exclusive events have additive probabilities.

But from an insurance perspective, these axioms are the reason the entire business has a mathematical foundation. Non-negativity translates directly to the fact that negative premiums don't exist. Normalization to one means the sample space is exhaustive: if you're pricing an auto policy, the universe of possibilities -- from zero claims to total loss -- must sum to one. If it doesn't, your model has a gap where money escapes. And countable additivity for exclusive events is what lets you decompose a risk portfolio into parts and work with each separately.

What isn't obvious until you start solving problems is that these three axioms imply a whole set-theoretic machinery. The complement rule, P(A) = 1 - P(not A), follows directly from the second axiom. Inclusion-exclusion -- P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) -- is a consequence of additivity. In practice, an actuary evaluating multiple coverages in a property policy uses inclusion-exclusion to avoid double-counting scenarios where two types of loss occur together. They don't need to know they're using sigma-algebra properties, but that's exactly what they're doing.

## Conditional probability: almost nothing in insurance is unconditional

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). Conditioning means shrinking the universe. When an actuary asks "what is the probability of a claim given that the insured is 22 and lives in an urban area?", they're removing everyone who doesn't meet that condition from the analysis.

Almost nothing in insurance is unconditional. Claim probability depends on age, location, history, property type, occupation. The risk classification process that insurers use -- and that regulators like Mexico's CNSF enforce through the LISF and CUSF -- is fundamentally an exercise in conditional probability. Each rating variable (age, sex, territory, vehicle type) partitions the sample space into subgroups with different risk profiles. When an actuary builds a rate table, they're estimating P(claim | insured's profile) for every possible combination.

Exam P presents problems with joint frequency tables that force you to distinguish between P(A and B), P(A|B), and P(B|A). Confusing the direction of conditioning is one of the most common and most costly errors in practice. If you confuse P(young | accident) with P(accident | young), you can assign an incorrect premium to an entire demographic segment. The exam's distractors are designed to catch exactly this mistake: one answer that looks right but corresponds to the joint probability, another to the reversed conditional. It measures comprehension, not calculation.

The multiplication rule, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A), is the tool for modeling sequences. A probability tree for a water damage claim: P(pipe bursts) * P(damage exceeds $20,000 | pipe bursts). This decomposition into conditional stages is exactly how an actuarial frequency-severity model operates.

## Bayes: from formula to actuarial thinking

An auto underwriter receives an application from a driver with three accidents in two years. Instinct says deny. But instinct isn't an actuarial tool -- Bayes is.

Three ingredients needed. The base rate: in the general portfolio, what proportion of drivers are high-risk? Suppose 20% -- that's the prior. The likelihood: if a driver *is* high-risk, what's the probability of three accidents in two years? Suppose 15%. And if low-risk? Maybe 2%.

P(high-risk | 3 accidents) = P(3 accidents | high-risk) * P(high-risk) / P(3 accidents)

The denominator via the law of total probability: P(3 accidents) = 0.15 * 0.20 + 0.02 * 0.80 = 0.030 + 0.016 = 0.046. So P(high-risk | 3 accidents) = 0.030 / 0.046 = 0.652. The prior of 20% became a posterior of 65%. Evidence updated the belief, and the underwriter now has a quantitative basis for the decision.

This is the conceptual ancestor of credibility theory -- one of the most important tools in actuarial practice. Credibility does what Bayes does but at scale: it blends individual experience with the full portfolio to produce an estimate better than either alone. Mexico's CNSF, through its risk classification circulars, implicitly requires Bayesian reasoning: technical memoranda must justify how portfolio experience calibrates claim probabilities. The word "Bayes" rarely appears in regulatory language, but the logic is identical.

The most famous counterintuitive Bayes result -- and the SOA's favorite -- involves diagnostic testing. A test with 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity looks highly accurate. But if the disease has 1% prevalence, the probability of actually being sick given a positive is only about 8.8%. Most positives are false. Directly applicable to fraud detection in insurance: a rule that looks good on hit rate can generate overwhelming false positives if the base rate of fraud is low.

## The goal: make it automatic

The SOA places general probability as Topic 1 -- between 25% and 30% of the exam weight -- because it's the conceptual foundation for everything that follows. Random variables in Topic 2 are functions on the sample space the axioms formalize. Multivariate distributions in Topic 3 are extensions of conditional probability. Everything builds on these three pillars.

This section is interesting and ultimately quite compact. My goal is to do 300 exercises this month -- enough that I never have to *think* about how to solve these problems again. So that automatic thinking kicks in, so resolution flows without conscious effort. Not because the problems are trivial, but because with enough deliberate practice the mechanics become instinctive and I can save mental energy for the problems that actually need it.

In my portfolio, these ideas show up in concrete places. The A/B testing project uses Bayesian inference to decide whether one variant outperforms another -- same logic of prior, likelihood, and posterior. The credit risk model with GLMs estimates conditional default probabilities given a financial profile.
