Three interactive demonstrations built with React and SVG that let you directly manipulate the parameters of fundamental concepts from calculus and complex analysis.

## What's included

- **sin(x)/x limit**: Geometric visualization of the fundamental limit using the unit circle. Drag the angle and watch the ratio converge to 1.
- **Derivative of sine**: Manipulate the point on the curve and observe how the tangent line slope traces out cosine.
- **Euler's formula**: Explore the relationship between complex exponentials and trigonometric functions in the complex plane.

Each visualization is designed to build intuition before formalization. The goal isn't to prove theorems but to understand *why* the results are true.
